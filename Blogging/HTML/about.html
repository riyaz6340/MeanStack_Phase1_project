        <h3 style="text-align: justify; padding: 10px">Car manufacturer Bugatti has built a one-off supercar from carbon fibre, which has already been sold to an anonymous enthusiast for a price of €11 million.
          <br/><br/>
          Unveiled at this year's Geneva Motor Show, La Voiture Noire – French for "the black car" – was sold to an unnamed Bugatti aficionado for an eight-figure sum.
          <br/><br/>
          While the final price hasn't been confirmed, Bugatti disclosed that the car was bought for €11 million (£9.5 million) before tax – estimated at €16.7 million (£14.4 million) including tax – making it "the most expensive new car of all time".
          <br/><br/>
          At this price, La Voiture Noire surpasses the Rolls-Royce Sweptail, which was sold to a private client in 2017 for approximately $12,800,000 (£9.8 million) including tax.
